# Home Assistant API Gateway

A lightweight API gateway for the Home Assistant REST API, useful for one-off triggers or gateway servers.

## Background

This app as actually created as a way to control my HA-connected devices from apps that didn't support full JSON/REST APIs. Using this app you can construct simpler WebHook-style links that most any app or device will support.
